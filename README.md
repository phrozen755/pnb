# DCS World Neko Project Blimp

This is a free, open source, SFM, Blimp independent module for DCS World. By independent it is meant that it does not require any other modules to work.

The development is in a very early stage, but the author has decided on releasing it in hopes it will help others on the implementation of modern aircraft systems using SFM.

All aircraft systems are implemented in Lua and can be freely used in other non-paid DCS World Modules. This project used the [A-29B](https://github.com/luizrenault/a-29b-community) as a boiler plate for making a fresh new DCS module.
